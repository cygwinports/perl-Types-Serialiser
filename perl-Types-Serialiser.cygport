NAME="perl-Types-Serialiser"
VERSION=1.0
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl serialisation data types module"
DESCRIPTION="This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a repository
of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by different
implementations so they become interoperable between each other."
